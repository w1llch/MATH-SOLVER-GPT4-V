# MATH-SOLVER-GPT4-V
Hello! Thanks for checking out my math solver :) Make sure to add your OpenAI key if you want to use it!

very early stage snipping tool-esque math problem solver, with the ability to solve basic and even complex problems simply by clicking on your screen. Made in Python. 


sometimes GPT doesn't want to solve the given input :( . I will test better prompts, but I will probably have to end up using code interpreter even though it seems to be $0.03/session.

In case you want to use this for yourself, I will try to create a GUI but that will take some time as I am busy with school and learning other things. I would use gpt to make it, but that feels like cheating lol.

I run this in the Pycharm IDE. To take a picture, run the program and create a "box" (it will be invisible) around your math problem by clicking two diagonal vertices. After that, your problem will (hopefully) be solved!

FUTURE PLANS:
- add a gui, that way the user will not have to alt tab over to the problem in order to avoid placing a vertex at the wrong area.
- add a token limit option for the response to avoid unneccessary and excess costs
- add a 20% opacity overlay over the entire screen, that excludes the selected area, in order to give the user a better idea of where they are clicking
- add a confirm image feature in the gui that allows the users to retake the screenshot before inputting to GPT if it is not ideal
- LaTeX!!!!!
